# To-Do-App
To-Do List App The To-Do List App is a simple yet powerful productivity tool built using React JS. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, viewing, and deleting tasks. This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn the basics of React, such as state management, event handling, and rendering dynamic content.
Features:
Add Tasks: Users can type a task into the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
Delete Tasks: Each task in the list has a "Delete" button that allows users to remove tasks once they're completed or no longer needed.
Task Management: The app keeps track of tasks and displays them dynamically as they're added or removed, providing an interactive user experience.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it easy to use on both desktops and mobile devices.
Technologies Used:
React JS: For building the user interface and managing the app's state.
CSS: For styling the app and making it visually appealing with a clean, modern design.
App Workflow:
Adding Tasks: A task is added when the user types in the input field and clicks the "Add Task" button. The task is stored in the state and displayed in the task list.
Deleting Tasks: Users can click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list. The task is filtered out from the state, and the UI is updated.
Visual Design: The tasks are displayed in a neat list with hover effects for better user experience. Each task has a background color and subtle shadow to give it a card-like appearance.
Future Enhancements:
Task Completion Status: Add checkboxes to mark tasks as completed or pending.
Task Persistence: Save the tasks in localStorage so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.
Edit Task: Allow users to edit tasks after adding them.
Task Prioritization: Add priority levels for tasks (High, Medium, Low).
